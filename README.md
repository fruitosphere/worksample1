<p> Hello, Felix Resenson here, and welcome to my work sample repository!<br/>
  Here, you can find some of the personal projects I've been working on for some time. They are largely modules for use on a separate site, which accepts HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap code. 
  I have taken base templates from the site and expanded upon them, adding layout elements, buttons, galleries, and more. 
  I have also personally spearheaded the design of these modules, elements of which are easily able to be changed by other users of this code.
